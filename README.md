  - Be aware of [general settings](https://illinois.zoom.us/profile/setting) and meeting settings.
    - Consider disabling email notifications when users join.
    - Consider enabling "Mute participants upon entry."
  - Be aware of Screen Sharing and "Whiteboard."
  - As "host" you have the ability to mute other users. Use this!
  - Can be recorded.

## "Lecture"

- Synchronous versus Asynchronous?
  - Don't be afraid of asynchronous
  - Use Zoom for synchronous. But this is strongly discouraged, especially for "large" classes.

## Video Distribution

- [Illinois Media Space](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/)
